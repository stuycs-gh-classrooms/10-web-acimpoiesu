<h2> National Hockey League Overview </h2>
  <p>The National Hockey League  is a professional ice hockey league consisting of 32 teams, divided into two conferences: the Eastern Conference and the Western Conference. Founded in 1917, the NHL is considered the premier professional ice hockey league in the world. The league oversees the highest level of competition in professional hockey and hosts the annual Stanley Cup playoffs, which culminates in the awarding of the Stanley Cup trophy to the league’s champion.</p>

<p>Founded in 1926, the Rangers are one of the Original Six teams in the NHL, alongside the Boston Bruins, Chicago Blackhawks, Detroit Red Wings, Montreal Canadiens, and Toronto Maple Leafs. In their nearly 100 year existence the Rangers have won 4 Stanley Cups with their most recent one being in 1994. Since then the Rangers have been a consistently above average team, however, never good enough to reclaim their crown at the top. Fun Fact: I have watched them play in person a few times. </p>
<h2> New York Islanders </h2>
  <p>The New York Islanders, a professional ice hockey team based in Brooklyn and now Long Island, have faced their share of challenges and setbacks throughout their history. Established in 1972, the Islanders have had periods of both triumph and adversity on the ice. While the team experienced success in the early 1980s, winning four consecutive Stanley Cup championships from 1980 to 1983, they have struggled to replicate that level of success in recent years. The Islanders have consistently been one of the worst teams in the NHL to the dismay of their fans.
