  <h2> National Hockey League Overview </h2>
  <div class="contentpg0">
  <p>
    The National Hockey League  is a professional ice hockey
     league consisting of 32 teams, divided into two
      conferences: the Eastern Conference and the Western
      Conference. Founded in 1917, the NHL is considered
      the premier professional ice hockey league in the world. It is actually
      the only major hockey league in the world and takes talent from all around
      the world (usually from cold places). Because of this it oversees the
       highest level of competition in professional hockey and hosts the annual
        Stanley Cup playoffs, which culminates in the awarding of the Stanley
       Cup trophy to the leagueâ€™s champion. Before this happens an 82 game
       regular season occurs to decide who makes the playoffs.

  <p class="playoffs">
The NHL playoffs are the culmination of the league's competitive season,
where teams battle it out in a series of best-of-seven matchups to
determine the ultimate champion. To understand this the NHL is randomly
made into 3 divisions in each conference. Following the regular season, the best 3
 teams from each division, along with 2 wild card entries per conference,
        qualify for the postseason. Seeding is determined by regular season
         standings, with higher-seeded teams enjoying home-ice advantage in the
          series. As teams progress through the rounds, the intensity ramps up,
           leading to the highly anticipated Stanley Cup Final, where the
            Eastern and Western Conference champions clash in a final showdown.
    Last year, the Las Vegas based team called the Las Vegas Golden Knights
    was able to become the Stanley Cup Champions by defeating the Florida Panthers
    4-1.
