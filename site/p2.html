  <p>The New York Islanders, a professional ice hockey team based in Brooklyn
     and now Long Island, have faced their share of challenges and setbacks
      throughout their history. Established in 1972, the Islanders have had
       periods of both triumph and adversity on the ice. While the team
        experienced success in the early 1980s, winning four consecutive Stanley
         Cup championships from 1980 to 1983, they have struggled to replicate
          that level of success in recent years. Their most recent succesful season
          was in 2020 when they were 2 wins away from making the Stanley Cup Finals
          and they have not reached anywhere close since.

  <p class="playoffs">
    The New York Islanders of the early 1980s were a hockey powerhouse,
     establishing an unparalleled dynasty in the National Hockey League.
      They were coached by the esteemed Al Arbour, and boasted a formidable
       lineup featuring hall of fame players such as Bryan Trottier, Mike Bossy,
      and Denis Potvin. This combination of excellence by players and coaches
      allowed the Islanders to win 4 straight Stanley Cups which is tied for the
      2nd highest streak.
