  <h2> Hockey Overview </h2>
  <p>
    Hockey is played in a ovular rink with boards surrounding the perimeter and
     goal nets situated at each end. Each team typically consists of six players
      on the ice at a time: three forwards, two defensemen, and one goaltender.
      The game begins with a faceoff at center ice, where the puck (basically a
      flat ball) is dropped between two opposing players to start play. Players
      move across the ice using specialized ice skates, wielding hockey sticks to
       control and propel the puck. The primary objective is to maneuver the puck
      into the opposing team's goal net while defending their own net from scoring
       attempts. This requires precision stickhandling, passing, and shooting skills,
      as well as strategic positioning and teamwork to outmaneuver opponents and
       create scoring opportunities. A hockey game is split into 3, 20 minute, periods
       and like most sports whichever team has the most points by the end of that time
       wins.
