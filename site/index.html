        Hockey is played in a ovular rink with boards surrounding the perimeter and
        goal nets situated at each end. Each team typically consists of six players
        on the ice at a time: three forwards, two defensemen, and one goaltender.
        The game begins with a faceoff at center ice, where the puck (basically a
        flat ball, picture on Rangers page) is dropped between two opposing players to start play. Players
        move across the ice using specialized ice skates, wielding hockey sticks to
        control and propel the puck. The primary objective is to maneuver the puck
        into the opposing team's goal net while defending their own net from scoring
        attempts. This requires precision stickhandling, passing, and shooting skills,
        as well as strategic positioning and teamwork to outmaneuver opponents and
        create scoring opportunities. A hockey game is split into 3, 20 minute, periods
        and like most sports whichever team has the most points by the end of that time
        wins.

      puck immediatly, winning faceoffs is vital for scoring in hockey.
