<h2> New York Rangers </h2>
<p>Founded in 1926, the Rangers are one of the Original Six teams in the NHL, alongside the Boston Bruins, Chicago Blackhawks, Detroit Red Wings, Montreal Canadiens, and Toronto Maple Leafs. In their nearly 100 year existence the Rangers have won 4 Stanley Cups with their most recent one being in 1994. Since then the Rangers have been a consistently above average team, however, never good enough to reclaim their crown at the top. Fun Fact: I have watched them play in person a few times. </p>
