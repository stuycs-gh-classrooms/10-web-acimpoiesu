<h2> New York Rangers </h2>

  Founded in 1926, the Rangers are one of the Original Six teams in the NHL,
   alongside the Boston Bruins, Chicago Blackhawks, Detroit Red Wings, Montreal
    Canadiens, and Toronto Maple Leafs. In their nearly 100 year existence the
     Rangers have won 4 Stanley Cups with their most recent one being in 1994.
      Since then the Rangers have been a consistently above average team,
       however, but never good enough to reclaim their crown at the top. In that time
       they made 1 Stanley Cup Finals, and the round before that called the Eastern
       Conference Finals 5 times. I have also watched them play in person a few
        times and they are my favorite hockey team.

      <h3> New York Rangers 2014 Season </h3>

      <p>
        The 2014 season of hockey was the first year I started watching hockey
        and also happens to be their best season of hockey since 1994. This team
        was one of the best teams in the regular season especially because their
        goalie, a man named Henrik Lundqvist, was one of the best players in the
        league that season. Once making it into the playoffs they barely made it
        through the first 3 rounds by the skin of their teeth winning 4-3 in the first round,
        4-3 in the second round and 4-2 in the 3rd round. This however led them to
        be in the Stanley Cup Finals against the Los Angeles Kings. This series
        went very poorly and the Rangers lost the series 4-1 and haven't made it
        to the finals since.
